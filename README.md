## Welcome to some basic interview prep exercises! 

This is a compilation of my algorithms to the exercises in [Cracking The Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) by Gayle Laakmaan McDowell. 

This is a work in progress, and should not be considered the only or most efficient solution list. If you have a better solution to one of the questions in the book, please feel free to contribute by making a pull request!

Each completed algorithm is tested in the tests.cpp file. The C++ Test Framework being used is [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2). The tests included should not be considered an exhaustive test suite; not all edge cases have been included. If you have a test you think would be beneficial to add into the test suite, please feel free to contribute by making a pull request! 

Cheers, and good luck.
